# Hexagonal Architecture

In the evolution of software architecture, [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) has been at the centre. There is an emphasis on breaking applications into components which can be switched, replaced or updated without affecting the dependent components.

Hexagonal architecture is another advancement in loosely coupled architectures. It originated around the beginning of the shift to domain-driven designs and formed a basis of further advancements in the field of software design. 

## Intoduction

A hexagonal architecture is divided into three parts and defines the strict roles that these parts play within the application.

**User Interfaces**

There can be many user interfaces to a backend - mobile apps, web apps, desktop softwares, etc. 




## Problems in traditional software architectures

1. Strong dependencies between layers
2.
