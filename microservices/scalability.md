# Scalability

Scalability is one of the top concerns when it comes to designing software systems. Applications are generally created with the objective that someday there will be a large number of users using them. 

However, the initial application does not need to support a large number of users. It needs to expand when necessary but overall keep the cost low as long as it can.

## Definition

> "Scalability is the measure of a systemâ€™s **ability** to **increase or decrease** in performance and cost **in response to changes in application and system processing demands**."
> > -- <cite>Gartner</cite>

Let's reiterate the keywords:
1. Ability - As stated earlier, does not have to be super strong at the beginning, but should be able to evolve when needed.

2. Increase or decrease - Upwards isn't the only direction. To optimize the cost, it needs to shrink too otherwise we will be spending more on resources and reducing our profits.

3. In response to changes in demand - Demand can be divided into two parts. It's not only the users that can increase, but we also want to occasionally add features too. The application needs to monitor the impact of user/feature changes and scale accordingly - whether automatically or through manual intervention.
