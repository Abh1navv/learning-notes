# The Art of Effective Meetings
We have all been through this phase lately where the number of meetings being added to our calendars has increased. Some of us are still working remotely and having long tiring communications throughout the day has been mentally draining us. But this is not what meetings are supposed to be. They are supposed to make things easier and efficient for eveyone involved. So how can we make our meetings more meaningful and efficient.

Let's define what an effective meeting is through some simple and vague measures of success:

1. Objectives - It has well defined objectives to start with and at the end manages to achieve them. Objectives can be of different kinds - a plan for the day, defining next steps, creating an idea board, getting to know each other.

2. Time - It finishes within the allotted time and does not digress from the agenda. 

3. A sense of achievement - Every person involved leaves with a feeling that the meeting achieved something for the team. It gets you out of problems, makes your plans clearer and gives your motivation to get things done.
